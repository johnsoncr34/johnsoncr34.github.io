            <p>Serving as a development lead, I played a pivotal role in onboarding new engineers and leading critical projects that drove significant business impact. I onboarded over a dozen engineers, guiding them through orientation, fostering a collaborative culture, and ensuring they had the tools and knowledge to succeed. I conducted monthly one-on-ones to support their career goals and provided regular feedback.</p>
            <p>Leading cross-functional teams, I spearheaded high-impact projects such as introducing customer survey intercepts for product feedback, adding real-time events for product marketing campaigns, rebranding our product, and migrating sign-ups and authentication to Intuitâ€™s ecosystem solutions. These initiatives required meticulous planning, execution, and collaboration with product managers and designers to ensure seamless integration and high-quality outcomes. I created data-backed documentation to scope work accurately, raise concerns early to leadership, and inform stakeholders to keep projects on track.</p>
            <p>In addition to my leadership responsibilities, I consistently contributed by executing on development tasks and reviewing pull requests, ensuring progress on each project. My open contributions to other Intuit services on these projects expedited work on dependencies and provided opportunities to work in different tech stacks outside my development organization.</p>
            <p>I took ownership of various projects, developing monitoring and alerting systems to ensure long-term success, and providing ongoing support, documentation, and training. Additionally, I developed a suite of UI regression tests in Cypress, with a Jenkins pipeline for regular test runs and automated alerts, ensuring critical product workflows remained intact and issues were caught early. I championed a blameless culture, collaborating on root cause analyses, and defining action items to prevent future issues.</p>

            <p>I quickly integrated into Intuit's processes, products, and technologies while contributing individually and collaboratively within Agile teams. I delivered on development sprint tasks, wrote automated tests and comprehensive test plans, and performed code reviews to ensure code quality. Actively participating in agile ceremonies, I estimated work, reflected on sprint outcomes, and suggested improvements for future iterations.</p>
            <p>A key responsibility was monitoring application health and resolving production issues, where I investigated root causes, accounted for rollbacks, and measured customer impact. I communicated findings and lessons learned across the product development organization to drive continuous improvement.</p>
            <p>I authored comprehensive design documents for new features, working closely with product managers and designers to align on requirements and UI changes. This included detailing architectural decisions, UI modifications, schema changes, rollout plans, and monitoring strategies. I also outlined and estimated manageable tasks to ensure clear tracking of progress and dependencies.</p>
            <p>In addition to development work, I participated in an escalations rotation, building customer empathy by addressing production issues and collaborating with customer support to provide timely remedies and next steps.

            <p><strong>Dates:</strong> Jan 2017 - Jul 2018 <span class="duration">(1 year 7 months)</span></p>
            <p>I successfully led the development of a new web application using the Angular framework, establishing development processes and standards for our team. This project culminated in a high-quality web client that met internal needs and introduced a new feature to our existing REST API service.</p>
            <p>In addition to web development, I gained proficiency in .NET Core, NuGet, and PowerShell scripting, applying these skills to enhance our continuous integration (CI) environment using Atlassian's Bamboo. I played a key role in addressing build and artifact needs, participating in a Bamboo CI group to improve processes and assist other teams transitioning to the Atlassian suite.</p>
            <p>My contributions included planning and implementing the deployment of the service with .NET Standard, enabling cross-platform compatibility. Despite the rapid evolution of .NET Core and challenges with dependent service compatibility, I remained diligent and methodical, ensuring a successful and risk-aware deployment.</p>

            <p>I developed a full-stack solution for a customizable workflow editor enabled customers to define workflows for versioning device settings. This required extending the functionality of a Windows C# application using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and PostgreSQL. My responsibilities included defining software requirements, creating UML class and sequence diagrams approved through peer review, writing automated unit and integration tests, and planning and estimating project timelines.</p>
            <p>I also contributed to a new REST API service for managing device configuration data. Leveraging technologies such as the ServiceStack framework, C#, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, I extended the functionality of the API service by contributing to API definitions, business logic, automated tests, and schema definitions.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I mentored new interns, helping them acclimate to the development environment by supporting their onboarding with our tools, processes, and product.</p>
